# Welcome to my SlitScan project

I made this in 2011 after I saw this technique in a youtube video. I wanted to experiment with this myself. This was a quick project to see if I could make it work.
I used screen capturing to grab the image, which was the easiest way to get the image as well as it allows friends who are on a webcam to experience the effect also.

## Operation
Pressing the "Start" button starts the slit scanning process. The image will appear as it is rendered on the opposite side. This allows you to make adjustments as it scans.
After it has finished scanning you can save your image by clicking save. Currently, as of 3/9/2013, it supports only the bitmap format. 

## Allowing a friend to be SlitScanned
To have a friend be slit scanned, simply move their webcam image above the image of your webcam. Resize the window
to just cover your webcam's image. Press start and your friend will be slit scanned!
